We repackage the original tgz downloaded from threadingbuildingblocks.org
into a fresh tar.gz archive using the following commands:

$  TBB_VERSION=4.1-4 # <-- ADAPT THIS
$  tar xzf <original tgz file>
$  mv <resulting directory> tbb-${TBB_VERSION}
$  tar czf tbb-${TBB_VERSION}.tar.gz tbb-${TBB_VERSION}

Additionally we apply 3 patches to the build system of TBB before compilation.
Those allow both for easier handling of the build products as well as custom
naming of the resulting shared objects. In detail:

 -> custom_library_suffix.patch

This introduces an additional environment variable to specify a custom suffix
for the final shared library file names. When running `make` on the tbb source
tree, you can specify CUSTOM_SUFFIX to create results like: libtbb_cvmfs.so
(See src/makeHook.sh)

 -> symlink_to_build_directory.patch

This produces statically named symlinks to the build output directories created
by the TBB make file. We use these to conveniently access the build results out
of CMake later on. The original output directory names contain version and plat-
form information and are therefore hard to access in an automatic fashion.

 -> 32bit_mock.patch

Sets the build architecture to ia32 on certain old 32 bit platforms.



Here you have a mapping to the original archive names:

Original Name                   Repackaged Archive        TBB Version
tbb41_20130613oss_src.tgz       tbb-4.1-4.tar.gz          4.1 Update 4
tbb42_20131118oss_src.tgz       tbb-4.2-2.tar.gz          4.2 Update 2
tbb43_20141023oss_src.tgz       tbb-4.3-1.tar.gz          4.3 Update 1
